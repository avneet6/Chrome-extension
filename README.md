# PROJECT DESCRIPTION #

 - The Productivity Manager is an innovative Chrome extension designed to monitor and enhance users' productivity by managing and analyzing their web activities.This 
   extension aims to help users stay focused, reduce distractions, and optimize their time spent online.By utilizing the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) 
   stack, the extension provides robust backend functionalities for storing user preferences, generating insightful reports, and syncing data seamlessly across devices.

# Features #

1. Time Tracking:
   - The extension will monitor the time users spend on various websites.
   -  It will categorize websites into productive (e.g., work-related sites) and non-productive (e.g., social media) categories, providing detailed insights into 
      users' online behavior.

2. Website Blocking:
   - To minimize distractions, the extension will allow users to block certain websites during specified hours.
   -  Users can create custom block lists and schedules, ensuring they stay focused during critical work periods.

3. Daily Productivity Reports:
   - At the end of each day, users will receive a comprehensive productivity report.
   -  This report will include statistics on time spent on different websites, productivity scores, and suggestions for improving focus.

4. User Preferences and Settings:
   - Users can customize their experience by setting preferences such as blocking specific websites, setting focus hours, and choosing notification preferences.
   - These settings will be stored in the backend, ensuring they are synced across all devices.

5. Data Synchronization:
   - The extension will utilize the MERN stack to ensure real-time data synchronization across multiple devices.
   - Users will have access to their productivity data and settings, regardless of the device they are using.

6. User Authentication and Security:
   - The extension will include user authentication features to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify their settings and data.
   - Secure methods like OAuth or JWT tokens will be employed to enhance security.
  
# Technology Stack #

1. MongoDB: Used for storing user data, preferences, and productivity reports. Its NoSQL structure allows for flexible and efficient data management.

2. Express.js: Acts as the backend framework to handle API requests, manage user sessions, and connect to the MongoDB database.

3. React.js: Provides a dynamic and responsive frontend for users to interact with the extension. React components will be used to create an intuitive user interface.

4. Node.js: Used for server-side development to handle user authentication, data processing, and communication between the backend and frontend.
